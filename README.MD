Game Player Performance Predictor (Decision Tree Regressor)

 This project [ um...yeah , I call this a "project".. :)) ] uses a Decision Tree Regressor (scikit-learn)
 to predict a player's in-game performance rating (0–100) using key gameplay statistics,
 like kills, deaths, accuracy, movement speed, and reaction time.  
It demonstrates how machine learning can analyze FPS game stats and estimate player skill levels.
